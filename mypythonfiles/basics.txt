PYTHON:
=======
 	it is a programming language.
 	it is a general purpose language.
 	python is a interpreted,object oriented ang High-Level language.Frame
 	it also supports procedural language.
 	python came into picture in 1989.
 	java-1995
 	python is much simpler than c,c++,java.
 	athor of Python:
 	================
 	Guido Van Rossum
 	he is the big fan of comedy film that is motte python flying circus.


 	PYTHON VERSIONS:
 	================
 	python 1.0 - january 1994
 	python 2.0 - october 2000
 	python 3.0 - December 2008


Mathematics:
============
- 10/3 -> float division and it gives quotient value
- 10//3 -> integer or float division
- 2*2*2 -> 2 power 3
- 2**3 -> another way to 2 power 3
- 10%3 -> modulus gives remainder value

  print() is a function it is a inbuilt function
  FUNCTION:
  =========
  function is a set of tasks which we will do
  we will also define our own functions.
  "\n" is a function it will work as to enter into new line

  RAWSTRING
  =========
  we use "r" to get raw data
  raw string means it prints as it is for that we will write as 
  ''' print(r'c:\docs\navin')'''


VARIABLES:
==========
variable is a container used to store values
		EX:
		===
			x=2
			x is container which is storing value 2
			we can change the value
			if we want to add previous output then we can use underscore( _ +y)
			ex:
				_+y
STRINGS:
========
	- strings in python are immutable
	- that means we cant change the value of a string once declared

LIST IN PYTHON:
===============
	-we can have different type of data
	-list contains combination of elements
		-ex: str,int,float values
	for listing we use square brackets
	 list is mutable
	 ctrl+space is used to list of functions
	 
square brackets default take as list.
TUPLE:
======

it is same as list
but tuple is immutable we cant change values.
for tuple we can use paranthesis()

iteration is fast in tuple as compare to list


SET:
====
	- set is a coolection of unique elements.
	- for set we can use curly braces.
	- set does not follow sequence.
	- set uses hash.
	- set does not fallow so indexing is not possibles
	- set is sameas list but difference is we set does not fallow equence.
	- set is mutable. 

# Data types in python
======================
None
	-when we have a variable and that is not assigned with any value then it is called none
	keyword-None
numeric
	-float
	-complex
	-bool
[list
tuple
set
string ->we dont have char in pyhon
range
	-when we iterate between valus we use range
	] ------------->these are called sequence
mapping or dictionary--> when we want to fetch data quickly then we use dict.for every value we assign a key. 

OPERATORS IN PYTHON:
====================

	arithemetic operators:

	assignment operators
	relational operators
	logical operators:
				and-->
					x  y  o/p
					0  0  0
					0  1  0
					1  0  0
					1  1  1
				or -->
					x  y  o/p
					0  0  0
					0  1  1
					1  0  1
					1  1  1
				not
	unary operators --> negation(if n=7 then negation =-7)
	for unary we use (-)

BITWISE OPERATORS:
  compliment(~)-->tilde
  and(&)
  or(|)
  xor(^)
  leftshift(<<)
  rightshift(>>)
